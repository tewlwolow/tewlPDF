# tewlPDF
## _A simple PDF manipulation programme_

tewlPDF is a simple programme to merge, split, reverse, cut or extract pages from PDF files. A much faster and safer alternative to free web-based projects, and a free and open-source alternative to paid solutions.

## Features

- Drag and drop PDF files
- Merge, split, reverse, cut, extract pages
- Reasonably fast and safe (no data collection involved! :>)
- Correctly handles password-protected files


## Installation

Will include a Windows executable. Otherwise download the archive, install Python (3, of course, we're not cavemen) and the required dependencies ([pikepdf](https://pypi.org/project/pikepdf/) and [pyqt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/)).

## Development

Feel free to contribute if you feel like it.
